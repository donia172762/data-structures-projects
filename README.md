# Data Structures Projects (C)

This repository contains multiple data structure implementations developed in C.
Each project focuses on a specific data structure and demonstrates its practical usage, including file handling and dynamic memory management.

---

## 1️⃣ Linked List Project

### Description
This project implements a singly linked list to store and process structured data.
The program reads data from an input file, dynamically creates nodes, and allows traversal and data output.

### Key Concepts
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Node creation and linking
- File input/output
- List traversal

### Files
- `linked-list/linked_list.c`
- `linked-list/districts.txt`

## 2️⃣ Stack & Queue Project

### Description
This project implements stack and queue data structures to manage data using different access policies.
The program reads commands or values from an input file and applies stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) operations.

### Key Concepts
- Stack operations (push, pop)
- Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- Array or pointer-based implementation
- Input-driven execution

### Files
- `Stack & Queue/stack-queue.c`
- `Stack & Queue/input.txt`

## 3️⃣ Hash Table and Tree Project

### Description
This project demonstrates the use of hashing and tree-based data structures for efficient data storage and retrieval.
An AVL tree is used to maintain balanced tree structure during insertions and searches.

### Key Concepts
- Hashing concepts
- AVL tree insertion and balancing
- Efficient searching
- Tree traversal

### Files
- `Hash Table AND Tree/avltree.c`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Standard C Libraries
- File Handling
- Dynamic Memory Management

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of these projects is to apply theoretical data structure concepts in practical C implementations and strengthen problem-solving and system-level programming skills.
